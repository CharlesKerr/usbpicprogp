Thank you to Frans for the origional USBPicProg which works extremly well.

This is a modification of the origional programmer to operate as a standalone pic programmer as well.

I have added a 64k i2c eeprom, a pushbutton switch and a 5v regulator.

The Schematic and board files are still in Kicad format.
